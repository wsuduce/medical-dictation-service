## 🔄 Documentation Maintenance Guidelines

### **📝 When to Update Documentation**

**BEFORE making any changes:**
1. **Review existing documentation** for the area you're modifying
2. **Update requirements** if the change affects business or technical specs
3. **Modify architecture docs** if the change affects system design
4. **Update roadmap** if timeline or scope changes

**AFTER completing changes:**
1. **Update implementation status** in relevant documentation sections
2. **Document new patterns** or architectural decisions
3. **Update version number** following the roadmap phases
4. **Validate cross-references** are still accurate

### **📋 Documentation Update Checklist**

For each development phase completion:
- [ ] Update version number in main README
- [ ] Mark completed roadmap items as ✅
- [ ] Update "Current Project Status" section
- [ ] Document any architecture changes or new patterns
- [ ] Update cross-references if new sections were added
- [ ] Validate all navigation links still work
- [ ] Update success criteria progress if applicable

### **🎯 Version Numbering System**

**Format**: `Major.Minor-Phase`
- **Major** (0.x): Pre-production development
- **Minor** (x.1-x.5): Development focus areas (Infrastructure, Templates, UX, etc.)
- **Phase** (xx-01, xx-02): Specific implementation phases within focus area

**Examples**:
- `0.1-00`: Documentation Foundation ✅
- `0.1-01`: Development Environment Setup (Next)
- `0.2-01`: Azure Speech Integration
- `0.5-04`: Final deployment-ready version

## 🏗️ Next Actions

1. **Immediate**: Begin [Development Environment Setup](Documentation/AI-Development-Guide/03-Implementation-Phases/01-Development-Environment/) → Target: `0.1-01`
2. **Phase 1**: Create [Core Project Structure](Documentation/AI-Development-Guide/03-Implementation-Phases/02-Phase-1-Core/) → Target: `0.1-02`
