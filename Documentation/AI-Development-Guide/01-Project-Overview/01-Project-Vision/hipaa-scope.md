## üè• HIPAA Overview & Applicability

### **What is HIPAA?**
The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) establishes national standards for protecting patient health information privacy and security.

### **Our Compliance Scope**

- **HIPAA Breach Notification Rule**: Requires notification of data breaches

### **Business Associate Status**
The Medical Dictation Service operates as a **Business Associate** under HIPAA, requiring:
- Formal Business Associate Agreements (BAAs) with covered entities
- Implementation of administrative, physical, and technical safeguards
- Compliance auditing and breach notification procedures
